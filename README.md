I extract only the IDs of buildings or sites from big json file full various information.

## How to use the script

1. Consider the data.json file is a huge data file from which I would like to get only the IDs of the sites or of the building.

2. Run the script inside the `extract-ids.js` file like this: `node extract-ids.js`

3. All the data will be printed in the console and extracted at the `input.txt` file
